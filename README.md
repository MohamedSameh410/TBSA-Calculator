# TBSA-Calculator
## Overview
This project is a tool for analyzing medical images to detect anomalies.

## Applications
* Early detection of diseases
* Image segmentation
* Image classification

## Functions
* Image preprocessing (noise reduction, normalization)
* Feature extraction (using convolutional neural networks)
* Anomaly detection (using clustering or outlier detection algorithms)

## Medical Assumptions
* Image data is preprocessed and normalized.
* Anomalies are represented by significant deviations from normal patterns.
* The used deep learning model is trained on a representative dataset.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* Python 3.6+
* NumPy
* OpenCV
* TensorFlow/PyTorch

### Installation
